A Google API key is required to use `lightbrarian`. See [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys) for instructions on how to generate the API key.

Once you've obtained an API key, set it as an environment variable in your shell before running any `lightbrarian` commands:
```
$ export GOOGLE_API_TOKEN=<INSERT TOKEN HERE>
```

# Developer Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fionniepollack/lightbrarian

$ cd lightbrarian

$ python3 -m venv .venv

$ source .venv/bin/activate

$ pip3 install --editable .

# Usage
The `lightbrarian` CLI utility supports two sub-commands:
- `lightbrarian search [-h] [--book-title BOOK_TITLE] [--book-author BOOK_AUTHOR] [--book-publisher BOOK_PUBLISHER] [--max-results MAX_RESULTS]`
- `lightbrarian list [-h]`

Run `lightbrarian --help` or `lightbrarian <subcommand> --help` for details on using each sub-command.

### Search
The `search` sub-command allows the user to search for books in the Google book store based using the following arguments:
```
--book-title
--book-author
--book-publisher
```

After the search results are displayed you'll have the option to save one of the books to your lightbrarian reading list.
